A simple "swat the mosquito" game for the 2025 National Dragonfly Day door decorating contest.

## How to Play

Use the dragonfly to eat the mosquitoes!

Mouse over the mosquitoes with the dragonfly's mouth to make them disappear.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note that this game was built for a very specific application, being projected on a glass door from a Windows computer,
and controlled by a mouse. Other configurations have not been tested, and may not work.
For example, this game _does not support_ touchscreens!
