#Introduction

Kill the mosquito game developed by Victor Araujo during the Javascript course.

Since the game was initially developed during an early stage of the course, a leaderboard was not added to the game.

##Features

The game allows the user to choose a level which will affect on how long the mosquitoes will stay on the screen.
* Easy: 1.5s (1500ms)
* Hard: 1s (1000ms)
* OMG: 0.75s (750s)

##What could be improved

* A leaderboard could be added to game.
* Change the way how the parameters are sent to the next page, to avoid passing them through the href.

Any feedback is welcome.
