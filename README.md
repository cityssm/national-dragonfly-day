# Introduction

Kill the mosquito game developed by Victor Araujo during the Javascript course.

Since the game was initially developed during an early stage of the course, a leaderboard was not added to the game.

## Features

The game allows the user to choose a level which will affect on how long the mosquitoes will stay on the screen.

## What could be improved

* A leaderboard could be added to game.
* Change the way how the parameters are sent to the next page, to avoid passing them through the href.

Any feedback is welcome.
